# Email Body Content Enhancement - Restoration of Original Requirements

## Issue Identified

The generated email body content had lost impact and length due to modifications in the system prompt. The original requirements for detailed, engaging email content with specific formatting had been inadvertently simplified.

## Root Cause Analysis

During previous modifications to fix HTML generation and add new features, the critical email body content requirements were reduced, resulting in:

- Shorter, less engaging email content
- Missing bold text emphasis
- Reduced use of emojis for visual impact
- Lack of detailed bullet points
- Missing corporate signatures
- Less urgent/notification-style language

## Original Requirements Restored

### 1. Enhanced API System Prompt (`/app/api/generate-broadcast/route.ts`)

#### Added Comprehensive Email Body Content Requirements

```typescript
## Email Body Content Requirements

The email body content should be engaging and detailed, focused on generating clicks on the CTA button or links. It MUST include:

- **Bold text** to highlight key information and create urgency
- **Emojis** (e.g., ‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è) for visual impact and engagement
- **Multiple bullet points** with action-oriented content
- **Embedded CTA phrases** within the text that create urgency
- **Corporate signatures** from fictional departments for authenticity
- **Direct, urgent language** that feels like an important notification
```

#### Enhanced Important Rules Section

- **EMAIL BODY MUST BE DETAILED AND ENGAGING:** Include multiple bullet points, bold text, emojis, and urgent language
- **INCLUDE CTA PHRASES:** Embed action-oriented phrases within the email body text that create urgency and drive clicks

### 2. Updated Documentation (`/lib/documents/emailgenius-broadcasts-generator-system-prompt.md`)

- Include multiple bullet points with emojis
