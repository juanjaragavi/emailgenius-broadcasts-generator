# Email Formatting Improvements - Line Breaks & Bold Signatures

## Issue Identified

Based on the user's screenshot, the generated email content had formatting issues when pasted into ActiveCampaign:

1. **Missing line breaks** after the greeting "Hi %FIRSTNAME%,"
2. **Missing line breaks** after important statements like "Important action required below."
3. **Signature not bold** - Department signatures like "The Card Issuance Team" were not formatted in bold

## Problems in the Original Output

The screenshot showed text that appeared as:

```markdown
Hi %FIRSTNAME%,Your Citi Simplicity¬Æ Card is almost here! We've shipped your card and want to make sure you receive it securely. Important action required below.
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Track your shipment: View the delivery status...
‚Ä¢ ‚ö†Ô∏è Confirm Receipt: Once your card arrives...
The Card Issuance Team
```

**Issues:**

- No line break after "Hi %FIRSTNAME%,"
- No line break after "Important action required below."
- "The Card Issuance Team" was not bold

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Email Body Structure Requirements

Updated the system prompt in `/app/api/generate-broadcast/route.ts` with **EXACT formatting rules**:

```typescript
### Email Body Structure Requirements:
Email content should follow this EXACT formatting pattern:

**REQUIRED FORMAT:**
Start with greeting, add blank line, then urgent message, add blank line, then bullet points, add blank line, then bold signature.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
- **Line break after greeting**: Always add a blank line after "Hi %FIRSTNAME%,"
- **Line break after main message**: Add blank line after important statements
- **Bold signature**: Always make the department signature bold using **text**
- **Proper spacing**: Use blank lines to separate sections for better readability
- **Bullet points**: Each bullet point should have an emoji and be on separate lines

**EXACT STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW:**
Line 1: Hi %FIRSTNAME%,
Line 2: (blank line)
Line 3: Main urgent message with bold text
Line 4: (blank line)
Line 5: - emoji Bullet point one
Line 6: - emoji Bullet point two
Line 7: - emoji Bullet point three
Line 8: (blank line)
Line 9: **Department Name**
```

### 2. Added Mandatory Formatting Rules

Enhanced the important rules section with specific requirements:

```typescript
- **MANDATORY LINE BREAKS:** Always add blank lines after greeting and main message for proper spacing
- **SIGNATURE FORMATTING:** Always make department signatures bold using **Department Name** format
```

## Expected Output After Fix

The generated email should now format as:

```markdown
Hi %FIRSTNAME%,

Your Citi Simplicity¬Æ Card is almost here! We've shipped your card and want to make sure you receive it securely. **Important action required below.**
