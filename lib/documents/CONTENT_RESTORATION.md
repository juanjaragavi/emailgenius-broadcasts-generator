# Email Body Content Restoration - Impact & Engagement Recovery

## Issue Identified

During the formatting improvements process, the comprehensive email body content requirements from the original system prompt were simplified, resulting in **less impactful and shorter email content**. The emails lost their engagement elements and click-through optimization features.

## Original Content Requirements (Restored)

Based on the original system prompt provided, the email body content should be much more detailed and include specific engagement elements:

### Key Elements That Were Missing

1. **Embedded CTA Links** - Action-oriented phrases within the text that appear as clickable links
2. **Multiple Engagement Touchpoints** - Bold text, emojis, bullet points throughout
3. **Detailed Example Structure** - Comprehensive template with all elements
4. **Impactful Content Guidelines** - Specific instructions for creating urgent, notification-style content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Restored Comprehensive Email Body Content Requirements

Updated the system prompt with the full content requirements from the original prompt:

```typescript
## Email Body Content Requirements

The content of the email should be engaging and detailed, focused on generating clicks on the CTA button or links. It MUST include:

- **Bold text** to highlight key information and create urgency
- **Emojis** (e.g., ‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è) for visual impact and engagement
- **Multiple bullet points** with action-oriented content
- **Embedded CTA phrases** within the text that create urgency and can be converted into clickable links
- **Corporate signatures** from fictional departments for authenticity
- **Direct, urgent language** that feels like an important notification
- **Concise but impactful content** typically under 200 words but packed with engagement elements
```

### 2. Added Detailed Example Structure

Included a comprehensive example that shows all required elements:

```markdown
Hi %FIRSTNAME%,

Your **account status** requires immediate attention. To ensure your card is delivered without delays, please **verify your shipping details** as soon as possible.

- ‚úÖ **Action Required:** [Confirm your address here](destination-url)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Your package is currently on hold pending your confirmation
- üìä **Status Update:** [View tracking details](destination-url) to monitor delivery

[Your concise, urgent, and direct message here. It should feel like a notification, not a marketing email.]

**[Fictional Team/Department Name]**
[Fictional Division, e.g., "Logistics & Fulfillment"]
```

### 3. Enhanced Structure Requirements

Combined the formatting improvements with comprehensive content requirements:

```markdown
**EXACT STRUCTURE TO FOLLOW:**
Line 1: Hi %FIRSTNAME%,
Line 2: (blank line)
Line 3: Main urgent message with **bold text** and embedded [CTA links](url)
Line 4: (blank line)
Line 5: - ‚úÖ **Bold text:** [Embedded CTA link](url) with action-oriented phrase
Line 6: - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Bold text:** Additional urgent information or [second CTA link](url)
Line 7: - üìä **Bold text:** Final bullet point with compelling action
Line 8: (blank line)
Line 9: [Concise, urgent closing message with any final [CTA link](url)]
Line 10: (blank line)
Line 11: **[Department Name]**
Line 12: [Division/Team information]
```

### 4. Strengthened Important Rules

Added specific rules to ensure impactful content generation:

```typescript
- **EMAIL BODY MUST BE DETAILED AND ENGAGING:** Include multiple bullet points, bold text, emojis, and urgent language for maximum impact
- **EMBEDDED CTA LINKS REQUIRED:** Include action-oriented phrases within the email body text that create urgency and drive clicks
- **MULTIPLE ENGAGEMENT TOUCHPOINTS:** Use bold text, emojis, bullet points, and embedded links throughout the content
- **IMPACTFUL CONTENT:** Generate concise but powerful content (under 200 words) packed with engagement elements
- **URGENT NOTIFICATION STYLE:** Content should imply urgent or necessary action regarding "card," "account," or "profile" without explicitly selling
```
