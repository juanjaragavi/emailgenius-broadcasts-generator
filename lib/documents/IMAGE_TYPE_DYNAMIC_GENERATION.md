# Dynamic Image Type Generation Implementation

## Overview

Updated the EmailGenius broadcast generator to dynamically incorporate the user's selected `Image Type` from the frontend form into the image generation process, ensuring that generated image prompts align with the specific type chosen by the user.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompt (`app/api/generate-broadcast/route.ts`)

#### Updated Image Generation Prompt Section

- Replaced generic image generation instructions with dynamic, type-specific guidelines
- Added detailed instructions for each image type supported by the frontend
- Included universal requirements that apply to all image types

#### Added Image Type Guidelines

The system now provides specific instructions for each image type:

- **product-image**: Focus on financial products with professional photography
- **lifestyle-photo**: Show people using financial services in realistic scenarios
- **infographic**: Create data-driven visuals with charts and clean design
- **icon**: Generate simple, recognizable financial symbols
- **animated-gif**: Describe subtle animation concepts for engagement
- **shipment-tracking**: Visualize delivery and tracking interfaces
- **graphic**: Design custom illustrations and branded graphics

#### Enhanced Important Rules

- Added `IMAGE TYPE COMPLIANCE` rule requiring strict adherence to selected image type
- Ensures AI references the Image Type Guidelines when generating prompts

### 2. Frontend Integration Verification

#### Confirmed Proper Data Flow

- Frontend form correctly passes `imageType` values to the backend API
- Image type options properly mapped:
  - `product-image` → "Imagen del Producto"
  - `lifestyle-photo` → "Foto de Estilo de Vida"
  - `infographic` → "Infografía"
  - `icon` → "Icono"
  - `animated-gif` → "GIF Animado"
  - `shipment-tracking` → "Seguimiento de Envío"
  - `graphic` → "Gráfico"

#### API Integration

- Form data includes `imageType` field in the request payload
- Backend properly receives and processes the image type selection
- User prompt includes the selected image type for AI processing

## Testing Results

### Test Cases Conducted

1. **Infographic Type Test**

   - Input: `{"imageType":"infographic"}`
   - Result: Generated infographic-specific prompt with step-by-step process visualization

2. **Product Image Type Test**

   - Input: `{"imageType":"product-image"}`
   - Result: Generated product-focused prompt with professional studio shot description

3. **Shipment Tracking Type Test**
   - Input: `{"imageType":"shipment-tracking"}`
   - Result: Generated tracking-specific prompt with smartphone interface and delivery elements

### Verification Results

- ✅ All image types generate appropriate, type-specific prompts
- ✅ AI correctly interprets and follows image type guidelines
- ✅ Generated prompts maintain 16:9 aspect ratio requirement
- ✅ Mobile optimization and accessibility guidelines preserved
- ✅ Application builds and runs successfully

## Benefits

### Improved User Experience

- Users get image prompts that match their specific selection
- More predictable and relevant image generation results
- Better alignment between user intent and generated content

### Enhanced Content Quality

- Type-specific instructions ensure appropriate visual style
- Detailed guidelines improve prompt quality and consistency
- Professional results for different image categories

### System Reliability

- Clear mapping between frontend selections and backend processing
- Consistent behavior across all supported image types
- Maintainable structure for future image type additions

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

- `/app/api/generate-broadcast/route.ts`: Enhanced system prompt with dynamic image type handling

### Files Verified

- `/app/page.tsx`: Confirmed proper form integration and data passing

### Key Features

- Dynamic prompt generation based on user selection
- Type-specific visual guidelines and requirements
- Seamless integration with existing UTM parameter system
- Backwards compatibility with existing functionality

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

- Add more specialized image types as needed
- Implement image type validation on frontend
- Consider A/B testing different prompt styles per type
- Add preview functionality for image type selection

### Maintenance Notes

- New image types can be easily added by extending the Image Type Guidelines
- Frontend and backend image type values must remain synchronized
- Testing should include verification of prompt quality for each type

## Testing Commands

# Test infographic type
curl -X POST http://localhost:3020/api/generate-broadcast \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform":"ConvertKit","emailType":"security-alert","market":"USA","imageType":"infographic"}'

# Test product-image type
curl -X POST http://localhost:3020/api/generate-broadcast \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"platform":"ActiveCampaign","emailType":"shipment-update","market":"USA","imageType":"product-image"}'

# Test shipment-tracking type
curl -X POST http://localhost:3020/api/generate-broadcast \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
