# EmailGenius Corrections February 4, 2026

- The content type selector between short, standard, or extended basically produces the same result. You have to refresh again for it to change and generate the one indicated.
- I am requesting product or lifestyle images, and it is outputting them in PNG format (it shouldn't, given the best practices guidelines I sent you), and it is also a PNG that AC does not recognize and does not allow to be uploaded. I have to convert them to JPEG.
- Several times the same person (Emily) appears as the sender.
- Eventually, the image result box displayed: “API quota exceeded. Please try again later.” and that's where it stayed. Do we have limits? Remember that we must consume GCP's; controlled, but we must.
- I tried putting the text and images directly into the email builder, and I got a bad Text/HTML ratio. So I copied the HTML directly from AC and optimized it with Gemini. It went from bad to fair. The problem with doing that is that as soon as the HTML changed, the email structure in the Builder was lost.
