# HTML to Markdown Fix - Email Body Generation

## Problem

The 'Cuerpo del Email' (Email Body) field was generating HTML content with tags like `<br>`, `<div>`, etc., instead of markdown text that could be directly copy-pasted into ConvertKit and ActiveCampaign interfaces.

## Root Cause

The AI system prompt was not explicitly prohibiting HTML output and emphasizing markdown formatting for the email body content.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated System Prompt in API Route (`/app/api/generate-broadcast/route.ts`)

- Added explicit **Critical Email Body Formatting Rules** section
- Clearly stated: **NEVER use HTML tags** in emailBody field
- Specified to use **MARKDOWN FORMATTING ONLY**:
  - Use `**bold text**` instead of `<b>` or `<strong>`
  - Use line breaks instead of `<br>` tags
  - Use bullet points with `-` or `*` instead of HTML lists
  - Use plain text formatting suitable for ConvertKit and ActiveCampaign

### 2. Updated Documentation (`/lib/documents/emailgenius-broadcasts-generator-system-prompt.md`)

- Added the same critical formatting rules to the main system prompt documentation
- Updated examples to show proper markdown formatting instead of HTML links
- Removed HTML formatting from all examples

### 3. Key Changes Made

- **Before**: Email body contained HTML like `<br><br>`, `<a href="">`, etc.
- **After**: Email body uses clean markdown formatting with line breaks, **bold text**, and plain text links

## Expected Output Format Now
